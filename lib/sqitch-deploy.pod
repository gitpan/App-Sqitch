=head1 Name

sqitch-deploy - Deploy changes to a database

=head1 Synopsis

  sqitch [options] deploy [--with-untracked]
  sqitch [options] deploy [--with-untracked] <tag>
  sqitch [options] deploy [--with-untracked] --to <tag>

=head1 Description

Deploy changes to the database. Changes will begin from the current deployment
state. They will run to the latest tag, unless a target tag is specified,
either via C<--to> or with no option flag, in which case changes will be
deployed up-to and including that tag.

If the database it up-to-date, no changes will be made. If a tag is specified
that appears earlier in the plan than the currently-deployed tag, an error
will be returned, along with a suggestion to instead use L<sqitch-revert>.

This is a to-do.

=head1 Specifying Tags

A C<< <tag> >> option typically, but not necessarily, names a tag object.

=over

=item C<tag>, e.g, C<beta>

A tag name.

=item C<HEAD>

Special symbolic tag for the last tag in the plan. Typically omitted.

=item C<HEAD+>

The last tag in the plan plus any untracked steps.

=item C<< <tag>^ >>, e.g., C<HEAD^^>, C<foo^3>

A suffix C<^> to a symbolic or actual tag name means the tag I<prior> to that
tag object. Multiple C<^>s indicate multiple prior tags. These can also be
written as C<< ^<n> >>, where C<< <n> >> represents the number of earlier tags
to go back.

=item C<< <tag>+ >>, e.g., C<HEAD+>, C<foo++>, C<bar+4>

A suffix C<+> to a symbolic or actual tag names that means the tag I<after>
that tag object. Multiple C<+>s indicate multiple prior tags. These can also
be written as C<< +<n> >>, where C<< <n> >> represents the number of later
tags to go forward.
